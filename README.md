# ♻️ Waste Management Classification Web App  

This project is a **Django-based web application** that classifies waste into categories such as **Organic** and **Recyclable** using a fine-tuned **Deep Learning model (TensorFlow/Keras)**.  
It is designed to promote **sustainable waste management practices** by enabling quick classification through image uploads.  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack  

- **Backend**: Django (Python Framework)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pillow  
- **Database**: SQLite (default, can be extended to MySQL/PostgreSQL)

## ⚙️ Features  

✅ Upload an image of waste and get classification results (Organic / Recyclable)  
✅ Fine-tuned deep learning model for accuracy  
✅ Simple, user-friendly web interface  
✅ Database integration for storing uploaded results  
✅ **Real-time camera-based waste classification**

## 🖼️ Model

The trained waste classification model is stored in:

```
Waste_classifier/model/waste_classifier.h5
```

It is loaded during runtime to classify images into **Organic** or **Recyclable**.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

* Multi-class waste classification (Plastic, Metal, E-Waste, etc.)
* Mobile app integration using Flutter
* Dashboard for analytics & monitoring waste patterns
